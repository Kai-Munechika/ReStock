Major changes
==============

1. Organized project package structure, see project_tree.txt

2. Added instructions how to run MongoDB from docker container. Eduardo is working in add the ful stack to run
   in the docker container, should be available soon.

3. Implemented Databse Pool Manager src/db/mongo_util.py to share database sessions avoiding new session/client be
   created by request.

4. Integrated MakeFile with some tasks ot this project. It is not 100% yet the way I wanted but you can run and see
   something like:

    (venv) [ecerquei@dev ReStock]$ make
    Please use  `make <target>\' where <target> is one of
      --- setup ---
      init              to initialize project, install pip packages and create virtualenv
      --- doc ---
      docs              to make documentation in the default format
      clean-docs        to remove docs and doc build artifacts
      --- code ---
      codecheck         to run code check on the entire project
      clean-cache       to clean pytest cache files
      clean-all         to clean cache, pyc, logs and docs
      clean-pyc         to delete all temporary artifacts
      --- run tests ---
      tests             run all tests
      --- Database ---
      db-import         database import
      db-drop           database delete
      --- Application ---
      run-app           run Flask application


5. Implemented Company entity using Object Oriented and moved to src/controller/Company.py

6. Integrated Logging in the core Flask application, see src/web/app.py search by app.logger. It is saving to
   restocked.log file but the application needs logging all over the codes in the tiers.

7. Created some basic unit tests src/tests/ as a guide/example.

8. Tested running the MongoDB in a docker container and connecting from my devel machine. I added a note about it
   in the README.md file.

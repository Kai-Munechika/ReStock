List with suggestion of items that can be improved in a next version
====================================================================

1. form needs validation. currently if you select a sector and skip your budget field and click at Find Companies button
   the app continues.

2. ERROR page, if you shutdown your MongoDB or simulate an connectivity issue like blocking the MongoDB port and
   hit the Find Companies button of home page you will see a ugly error "pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError
   pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError: localhost:27017: [Errno 111] Connection refused"

3. Database connection pool, to share DB connection instead of each call to create a new DB connection, optimizing DB
   access and allowing your application to run with more users.

4. Logging, I am missing the codes printing or logging. It is a good practice to make the application verbose
   and control the level of it. Special when the application is running in a server or in production with a
   high-availability configuration and not by $ python src/web/app.py you wont have access to stdout. During
   troubleshooting is necessary to have access of logs with past data.
